## 🐳 Running with Docker

Running it in Docker keeps it online in the background and restarts it automatically after a crash or reboot.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). On Linux you can use the convenience script:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
   ```
2. Download the repository (or just the `docker-compose.yml` file)
3. Create a file named `.env` next to `docker-compose.yml` and put your token in it:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
4. Optionally, edit the status settings in `docker-compose.yml`:

   | Variable | Description | Default |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Your Discord token (**required**) | — |
   | `DISCORD_STATUS` | `online`, `idle` or `dnd` | `online` |
   | `DISCORD_STATUS_MESSAGE` | Custom status text, leave empty for none | empty |
   | `DISCORD_EMOJI` | Set to `true` to show an emoji in the status | off |
   | `DISCORD_EMOJI_NAME` | Unicode emoji or emoji name | `🔥` |
   | `DISCORD_EMOJI_ID` | ID of a custom emoji (only needed for custom emojis) | — |
   | `DISCORD_EMOJI_ANIMATED` | Set to `true` for animated custom emojis | off |

5. Start the container:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Useful commands:
```sh
docker compose logs -f   # view the logs
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d   # update to the latest version
docker compose down      # stop it
```
